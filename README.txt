Don't Panic
-----------

After installing the product, you should get a viewlet at plone.abovecontent manager,
with a link to manage flashes.

Clicking the " Click here to add one." link, or the pencil at the right, 
you should get a view for adding, modifying or removing news flashes,
in an overlay, if your browser supports Javascript.

After clicking "Save", and reloading your site, you should get the news
flashes rolling over the top section.
